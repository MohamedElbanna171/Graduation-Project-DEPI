Manufacturing Downtime Analysis ðŸš§

This project is a Power BI dashboard developed to analyze manufacturing downtime, identify the key causes, and provide actionable insights for improving operational efficiency.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

- **Number of Products**: 6  
- **Operators**: 4  
- **Batches**: 38  
- **Downtime %**: 26% (filtered by operator error: Yes/No)

## ðŸ“ˆ Dashboard Features

- Top 10 batches by downtime
- Total downtime by product
- Downtime by operator
- Downtime by factor (e.g., machine failure, batch change)
- Filtering by operator error (Yes/No)

## ðŸ§  Recommendations

- Focus on high downtime days
- Improve training for specific products (e.g., CO-600, RB-600)
- Optimize processes for batch changes and belt blockage
- Adjust maintenance schedules
- Promote knowledge sharing among operators

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Benefits

- 15-20% productivity increase in 3 months
- 30% downtime cost reduction
- 25% error reduction
- Better flexibility and operator work environment
